Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.<br><br>
I am a passionate programmer, quick learner and a devoted developer. I consider myself a good public speaker, and I have a good sense of humour. I am currently pursuing my bachelors degree at IIT Roorkee. My area of interest comprises of operating systems, algorithms, databases and web development. Apart from computer science I am also self proclaimed chef and a keen book reader. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write, I like to think, I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late, I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes. I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.<br><br>

This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my <a href="/blog/html">blog </a>or follow me on facebook. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.
