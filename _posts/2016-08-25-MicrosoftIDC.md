## Preface

Summers 2016 was one of the most awaited summer vacation of my life. The excitement was all about my internship at MSIDC which I had secured through my college placement cell a year before. I had a fair idea through my college seniors about the royal treatment served to the interns by MS. This none the less created more curiosity.

In this post I will not talk about specifics of my work at MS as it is confidential under the contract of my employment but rather I will focus in general, the life I spent on the campus for 60 days and what is expected out of an intern at Microsoft.

## My Story

On 8th May 2016 I boarded a plane from Mumbai to Hyderabad with much excitement for my first career break ahead. It took 1 hour and 28 minutes precisely for me to reach Hyderabad. The weather at Hyderabad was not at all welcoming with temperature as high as 35 degrees in evening time.

### Accomodation
Around Six in the evening I reached the hotel. The accomodation provided by MS was fully air conditioned (which was needed in that weather) and wonderful. Here are the few clicks of the hotel room.

Generally 90% companies provide accomodation for no more than 14 days to their interns, in that time period they are expected to find a temporal stay. But MS provided accomodation throughout the intern period, for every intern.

### Travel

Interns were provided with full reimbursement facility for return air travel from their home city to hyderabad. So all of us had chosen to travel by air plane.

Accomodation facility was little far from Microsoft IDC. There was bus pickup and drop facility provided by Microsoft from our respective hotels to the Office. Buses were fully air conditoned, never over crowded and used to run in morning (8-11 am) and  evening(6-9 pm) only. If someone wishes to work till late night then a special cab facility was provided which would drop you home as late as 2 am.

### First Day

On first day all the interns were handed their temoprary ids. There was an orientation session followed by lunch and a nice campus tour. All the interns were strictly warned NOT to follow formal dress code. Every intern was given Microsoft goodies. We were assigned our teams and mentors on the first day itself and by the end of the day we knew what work each one had to do during his internship. I got assigned to work with Bing divison. 

Here are the few pictures clicked by me with my fellow interns at campus tour.

### Daily Routine

There were flexible work timings (even for interns). I came to work daily around 10, sometimes at 12 also. I was given a cabin shared with two other interns, each one of them working independently on different projects. Every day I learned new things from my mentors, manager, fellow interns and tried all of those things on my project. My ideas were never discouraged by my mentors nor I was made feel that I was just an intern. At times I would get stuck for hours at one single problem and sometimes I would spend hours playing pool and fooseball on campus. 

The work was very friendly and work enviornment motivating. There were team meetings held twice or thrice a week and all the interns were encouraged to join it. I attended few of them and had aboslutely no idea what was going on. One thing I liked about Microsoft was that they assign you work PC in the office in which you have to do your work. You are by no means allowed to carry your laptop to your cabin or shift your work to your laptop. This way they made it sure that work remained only in the office.

### Facilities

Interns were given free lunch (unlike permanent employees). The lunch menu included everything from north Indian thali to south Indian food. Hyderabadi Biryani was speciality and found its place on the menu almost every day. Sometimes there were chef specials including thai cuisines. There were separate juice counters and salad corners for health conscious crowd. Evening snacks were provided everyday free of cost for everyone working at MS. 
The pantry was full of juice, soft drinks, coffee machines and the best quality hand picked fruits .

In our free time I used to play pool and fooseball with my friends and sometimes with mentors. I got lucky few times to try new xbox one consoles. Sometimes I just used to relax and watch youtube videos on my work PC. There was no social media restrictions on our internet connection. You could just literally watch anything.

There was a lake in the campus and by its side small cafeteria. I throughly enjoyed my evening meals around lake because of soothing and appealing enviornment.

There was a football ground and cricket ground inside campus where we used to play with our mentors. By the evening you could see people running inside campus with their sport shoes and track pants on. The campus has one of the largest gymnasium.

### Extra Curriculars

Interns are very highly pampered at Microsoft. In our 7th week of internship, interns were taken to Wonderla, Hyderabad. The whole trip was financed by Microsoft. We enjoyed a lot. The trip was aimed at increasing morale of interns and getting them to know each other well.

After the intern morale event, came intern movie meet. On saturday of 25th June 2016 in our 7th week we were invited for a intern gettogether. Movie shows were arranged inside campus only with popcorn and chocolate waffles.Following movie there was delicious dinner treat. 

Apart from these outings each team had their own outings. I had been with my mentor to watch X-men Apocaplyse. On the last day of my intern I had been to a 5-star delicious lunch buffet with rest of my team. One of my friend who was in Cloud divison had went to watch IPL match in hyderabad.

### Expectations from Intern

Microsoft expects you to work sincerely on a project and enjoy your intern period. Sometimes my mentor used to yell at me for staying too long in the office. An intern is expected to complete his project during internship period. Projects assigned are not too big and can be completed within given time easily. In the last week of the intern there are interviews and based upon your technical knowledge and manager feedback they extend interns full time offer.

### My Take Away

I spent one of the happiest vacations of my life at Microsoft IDC. Even getting a hogwards letter at 11 wouldn't have been this blissful. I enjoyed and learnt a lot. It was my first exposure to sofware industry and luckily it was with the company who started the industry itself.
