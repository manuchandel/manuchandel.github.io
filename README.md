## My First Jekyll Blog

You can find my blog [here](http://manuchandel.com)

## Simple Jekyll Base Theme

* This is my personal blog and is based on simple jekyll base theme with some tweaks.
* I added Disqus, google analytics and social sharing buttons on base theme.

## Reasons to chose base theme

* Base theme is lightest of all and much faster to load.
* It works across various devices of varying pixel density and screen sizes.

## Star and Fork

Feel free to star this repository and fork it, if you liked this theme.
